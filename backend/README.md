# Onboarding Handbook

### Welcome & Introductions

We would like to welcome you to Pager Inc. The purpose of this onboarding handbook is to provide you with comprehensive guidance and direction during your onboarding, familiarize you with Pager Inc. systems, designate a coding buddy, and generally set you up for success.

### Team Structure at Pager

Pager engineering consists of five squads, most of them specializing in a different Pager product:

| Squad Name | Slack Channel | Email distro | JIRA Board |
| ----- | ------ | ---- | ---- |
| Management Enterprise (ME) | #squad-management-enterprise | squad-management-enterprise@pager.com | [ME backlog](https://pagerinc.atlassian.net/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=64&projectKey=ME&view=planning.nodetail&issueLimit=100) |
| Consumer Squad (CS) | #squad-consumer | squad-consumer@pager.com | [CS backlog](https://pagerinc.atlassian.net/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=49&view=planning.nodetail&issueLimit=100) |    
| Users Enterprise (UE) | #squad-users-enterprise | squad-users-enterprise@pager.com | [UE backlog](https://pagerinc.atlassian.net/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=79&projectKey=UE&view=planning&selectedIssue=UE-912&epics=visible&issueLimit=100) |    
| Professional Services Squad (PSS) | #squad-professional-services | squad-professional-services@pager.com | [PSS backlog](https://pagerinc.atlassian.net/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=87&projectKey=PSS&view=planning&selectedIssue=PSS-18&issueLimit=100) |
| Platform Squad (PS) | #squad-platform | squad-platform@pager.com | [PS backlog](https://pagerinc.atlassian.net/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=59&projectKey=PS&view=planning.nodetail&selectedIssue=PS-674&issueLimit=100) |

With the exception of platform squad, each squad contains engineers from frontend (web and/or mobile), backend, machine learning/data as well as QA. Here is the [org chart](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/14hRZNhhM9m_t88lR9jOoqDkvewiQDf3Rc0wW7n3iyDI/edit) for our squads.

During your first week, you will be meeting your team members, as well as team leads, who will provide you with important overview of their respective areas of expertise.

**Coding Buddy:** [Insert name]\
One of the key figures during your first few weeks is your coding buddy. Your coding buddy will be your initial source of information about various systems, tools and practices at Pager. In addition to being your go-to person for code related questions, you can expect your coding buddy to help you pick up your first coding assignments. This will help you dive into coding as quickly as possible, without overwhelming you.

**Your Direct Manager:** [Insert name]\
Your manager will meet with you on your first day to welcome you to Pager, get to know you, understand your personal and professional goals. The purpose of the first meeting is to introduce you to this document, and set initial expectations. You will have a second meeting with your manager at the end of your first week, to check-in on your onboarding progress and introduce you to your [30-60-90](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gQHA8cq6R8VS-mKz2Qe2OwoRHE8hGOsJPph4h9x9EfQ/edit?usp=sharing) day plan.
